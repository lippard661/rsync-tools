BUGS:

rsync-client/rsync-server:
There is currently no way to distinguish on the server (receiving)
side between different source dirs that share the same destination
dir, which means that the destination-cleanup for the 2nd and later
items in a list will never get executed, only the first one will
match. Best workaround is probably to execute all the
destination-cleanup commands for all invocations (presuming they don't
have negative effects when they aren't the matching entry). Otherwise,
some argument needs to be passed in the command line to specify the
source information to be used.

FEATURES TO ADD:

README file could use some expansion.
